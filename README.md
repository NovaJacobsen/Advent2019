##My solutions for Advent Of Code 2019

Welcome to my solutions repo for Advent of Code 2019

For the best experience when working on these problems run
the test suite by issuing `rerun -cx rspec` - now test will
run whenever you save a file!

Each folder represents a day and will always include (if I solved it):
 - input.rb which sets up the input for the challenges I was given
 - star1.rb and star2.rb which runs my solution for the silver and gold problems respectively
 - some number of helper classes and unit test thereof
